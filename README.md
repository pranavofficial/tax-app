How to Use:
To start the development servers for both the backend and the frontend, first, navigate to the `tax-app/backend` directory, install the dependencies using `npm install`, and then start the backend server with `npm run dev`.
For the frontend, navigate to the `tax-app` directory, install the dependencies, and start the frontend server using `npm run dev`.
After running these commands, the backend server will run on its specified port, and the front end will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001` (or another port if selected).
